**Gameboy Emulator in TypeScript/HTML5**

## Intro
The goal of this project is to implement a GameBoy emulator in TypeScript.
It's hardly the first, and surely not the last. I just want to learn more 
about the GameBoy architecture, and I'm curious about the limitations of 
hardware emulation in the browser.

## Milestones

- [X] Run Boot ROM
- [ ] Successful startup and logo screen
- [ ] Run Custom Test ROMs
- [ ] Run Tetris
- [ ] Run Pokemon Red
